# Security baseline

## Authorization

- PostgreSQL RLS is authoritative; model prompts are never access-control boundaries.
- Every private bot, KB, document, conversation and portfolio belongs to a user/workspace.
- The browser receives only a Supabase publishable key. Service-role credentials are worker/server secrets only.
- Private Storage uses signed uploads and RLS-constrained object paths.
- Retrieval searches only KBs linked to the selected accessible bot.

## Prompt injection

Retrieved files and web pages are explicitly treated as untrusted evidence, not executable instructions. Authorization, tool availability and data scope remain deterministic in code/SQL. Red-team evals should include documents that request system-prompt disclosure, cross-tenant data, tool abuse and citation fabrication.

## Data handling

- TLS at the platform boundary and provider encryption at rest.
- Private buckets and expiring signed URLs.
- Deleting a document removes stored versions before deleting database metadata.
- Avoid logging document contents, prompts containing sensitive records, tokens or API keys.
- Configure retention, backups, deletion workflows, DPA/BAA requirements and regional processing to match the markets you actually serve.

## Production launch checklist

- Configure Supabase Auth password/MFA/email rules.
- Enable provider spend alerts, WAF/rate controls and error monitoring.
- Run Supabase security/performance advisors after migrations.
- Run tenant-isolation tests against two real test users.
- Set secret scanning/Dependabot in the repository.
- Review every professional source's license and refresh SLA.
- Add a CSP nonce strategy if strict CSP is required by your deployment/compliance profile.

## Ingestion boundary

- User uploads are capped at 50 MB and should be scanned by a private ClamAV service before parsing (`MALWARE_SCAN_REQUIRED=true` in production).
- Curated-source downloads use public-IP URL validation, redirect re-validation, non-standard-port blocking and bounded streaming downloads to reduce SSRF/DoS risk.
- Keep worker egress restricted at the infrastructure layer as the stronger SSRF boundary.
- Run document parsing in a resource-limited container; treat PDFs, Office files, images and archives as hostile input.

## Browser mutation requests

Cookie-authenticated JSON mutation endpoints reject explicit cross-site browser requests and mismatched `Origin` hosts. This supplements SameSite cookies and RLS; it does not replace authorization.


## Tenant identity integrity

RLS determines which rows an authenticated principal may update. A separate trigger layer prevents authenticated clients from changing identity/linkage columns such as `organization_id`, `owner_user_id`, bot type, knowledge-base ownership, document-to-KB linkage, version storage paths and conversation ownership after creation. This closes a common gap where a permissive `WITH CHECK` could otherwise allow row reassignment.

Daily chat counters are readable by their owner but are no longer directly insertable/updatable by authenticated clients. Quota consumption is performed by a narrowly scoped `SECURITY DEFINER` helper in the non-exposed `private` schema, reached through a public security-invoker wrapper that still requires an authenticated JWT.
